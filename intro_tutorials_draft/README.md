## Python tutorials & intro to transient rheology

This is a draft of a jupyter-book introducing some python packages in the context of transient rheology, part of the iSTRUM broader impacts efforts. 

## requirements

```
pip install -r book_draft/requirements.txt
```

## building the book 

```
jupyter-book build book_draft
```

note: if you've previously built and have since updated chapters, you may need to clear out the old builds first.

check the rendered versions in `book_draft/_build/` and open `book_draft/_build/html/index.html` in a browser 

## hosting the book 

when ready, copy over the html folder at `book_draft/_build/html` to the main istrum repo.
